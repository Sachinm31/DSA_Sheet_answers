Problem: Length of the Longest Subarray with Sum 0

Given an integer array arr[] of size N, find the length of the longest
contiguous subarray whose elements sum to 0.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Input:
- An integer array arr[] containing both positive and negative numbers.

Output:
- Return an integer representing the length of the longest subarray
  with sum equal to 0.

Example 1:
Input:
arr = [1, -1, 3, -3, 4, -4]
Output:
6
Explanation:
The entire array sums to 0, so the length of the longest subarray is 6.

Example 2:
Input:
arr = [4, -2, -2, 2, 2, -4, 2]
Output:
6
Explanation:
The subarray [4, -2, -2, 2, 2, -4] has sum 0 and length 6.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- -10^5 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5

Expected Time Complexity:
- O(N)

Expected Space Complexity:
- O(N)
